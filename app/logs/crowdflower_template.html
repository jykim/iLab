Identifying Human-written Query

You will be provided with two queries, one written by a human, the other written by a machine. The goal of this task is to identify which one is written by a human.

<strong>Subject</strong> :&nbsp;
{{subject}}<br>
<strong>Date</strong> :&nbsp;
{{sent}}<br>
<strong>From</strong> :&nbsp;{{name}}&nbsp;(&nbsp;{{email}}&nbsp;)<br>
<strong>To</strong> :&nbsp;{{to}}<br>
<strong>Content</strong> :&nbsp;<br>
<p><textarea id="" style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; width: 700px; margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px; height: 220px; ">{{text}}
</textarea></p>


One of these queries was written by a human. Can you identify which query is it?

If you need to find this document using a search engine, what would you use as a query?

Why did you decide that way? Any other comments?
